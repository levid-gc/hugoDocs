      <description>Create Your Fork It&amp;rsquo;s best to make changes to the Hugo docs on your local machine to check for consistent visual styling. Make sure you&amp;rsquo;ve created a fork of hugoDocs on GitHub and cloned the repository locally on your machine. For more information, you can see GitHub&amp;rsquo;s documentation on &amp;ldquo;forking&amp;rdquo; or follow along with Hugo&amp;rsquo;s development contribution guide.
You can then create a separate branch for your additions. Be sure to choose a descriptive branch name that best fits the type of content.</description>
